Quiz Web Application README

--> Overview

	        oThis README provides documentation for a JavaScript-based quiz web application. The application allows users to participate in a quiz where they can answer multiple-choice questions within a limited time frame.
 		oThe questions are randomly selected from a pool, and users can track their scores as they  progress through the quiz. The application features interactive elements such as timers, answer  checking, and visual feedback for correct and incorrect answers.

--> Features

		oRandomized Questions: Questions are randomly selected from a predefined set to provide variability in 	each quiz session.

		oMultiple-Choice Answers: Each question has multiple-choice answers, allowing users to select the correct option(s).

		oTimer Functionality: A timer limits the time available for answering each question, adding a sense of urgency to the quiz experience.

		oScore Tracking: The application keeps track of the user's score as they answer questions correctly.

		oHeart System for Incorrect Answers: Users lose a heart for each incorrect answer, and the game ends if 	they run out of hearts.

		oReplay Functionality: After completing the quiz or losing the game, users can replay the quiz for another attempt.

		oSingle-Page Web Application: The application is designed as a single-page web app for a seamless user 	experience.

--> Technologies Used

		oHTML: Used for creating the structure and layout of the web page.

		oCSS: Applied for styling and visual enhancements of the web page elements.

		oJavaScript: Utilized for implementing the quiz logic, including question generation, timer 	management, and answer checking.

		oDOM Manipulation: Interacted with HTML elements dynamically to update content and handle user  interactions.

		oEvent Handling: Managed user events such as clicking buttons and selecting checkboxes for answering questions.

		oClosures: Utilized for maintaining state and encapsulating functionality within functions.

		oArray Methods: Used array methods like filter() and indexOf() for managing data structures and logic.

		oInterval Timers: Implemented timer functionality using setInterval() for tracking time limits.
